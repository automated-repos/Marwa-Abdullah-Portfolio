              Early in my career, I was deeply involved as a key contributor to a complex, multi-tenant backend project using PHP and Laravel. Just as we were heading to production, the company's focus shifted.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              I was asked to join the QA effort for a new project. Instead of seeing it as a setback, I embraced it. I discovered I had a knack for testingâ€”for thinking of edge cases and potential flaws. For months, I helped ensure the new product was robust and reliable.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              But I missed building. So I made a decision: I would dedicate myself to returning to development, intentionally rebuilding my skills with a new perspective. I immersed myself in modern PHP, Laravel best practices, and, crucially, began studying DevOps to understand the entire software lifecycle.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Today, I am a more well-rounded Software Engineer. My 2+ years of backend experience is now complemented by a tester's discipline for quality and a growing knowledge of CI/CD and automation. I don't just write code; I write resilient, well-considered code that stands up to scrutiny.
            </p>

              My journey taught me that the best developers understand how software can fail.
